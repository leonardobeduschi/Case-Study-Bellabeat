## Prepare
The project utilizes publicly available Fitbit Fitness Tracker Data sourced from Kaggle. This dataset was collected in 2016 through an online survey distributed via Amazon Mechanical Turk. Thirty individuals consented to share their fitness tracker data, which includes daily activity, step counts, and heart rate information. The data is stored in 11 separate CSV files and organized in a wide format, making it accessible for analysis.<br>
Data source: [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit)<br>

The Fitbit Fitness Tracker Data, collected in 2016 from 30 participants via Amazon Mechanical Turk, has several limitations that hinder its reliability for drawing broader conclusions:
- Data Age: 7 years old, making it outdated due to technological advancements and changing lifestyles.
- Small Sample Size: 30 participants is insufficient to represent the general female population.
- Data Source: Amazon Mechanical Turk may introduce biases in participant demographics and motivations.
- Missing Information: Lacks crucial data on age, gender, health conditions, and lifestyle factors.
- Data Completeness: Potential inaccuracies and incompleteness due to self-reporting and device limitations.

<br>These limitations, assessed using the ROCCC criteria (Reliability, Originality, Comprehensiveness, Currency, Cited), suggest that the data should be used with caution and further validated with more recent and comprehensive datasets.

## Process
The data analysis process involves a series of steps to ensure data quality and prepare it for effective analysis. Key tasks include checking for errors, selecting appropriate tools for data manipulation, transforming the data into a usable format, and meticulously documenting all cleaning procedures. This rigorous approach ensures data integrity and provides a clear audit trail for future reference and collaboration.

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```
- Import datasets
```{python}
daily_activity = pd.read_csv("/content/bellabeat/dailyActivity_merged.csv")
heart_rate = pd.read_csv("/content/bellabeat/heartrate_seconds_merged.csv")
hourly_calories = pd.read_csv("/content/bellabeat/hourlyCalories_merged.csv")

### Clean the data
- Search which data has duplicate values
  ```{python}
  for name, df in datasets:
  df[df.duplicated()]
  ```
- Search the total of null values in the dataset
  ```{python}
  for name, df in datasets:
  df.isnull().sum()
  ```
- Clean each table
  ```{python}
  for name, df in datasets:
  print(f"Cleaning dataset: {name}")

  # remove duplicates
  df.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)

  # remove rows with N/A values
  df.isnull().sum()
  df.dropna(inplace=True)

  print(f"{name} cleaned succesfully!\n")
  ```
- Preview the cleaned dataset
  ```{python}
  for name, df in datasets:
  print(f"Preview of cleaned dataset {name}")
  print(df.head())
  ```
- Changing the format of the date values to work with them in the analysis process
  ```{python}
  heart_rate["Time"] = pd.to_datetime(heart_rate ["Time"], format='%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p')
  hourly_calories["ActivityHour"] = pd.to_datetime(hourly_calories ["ActivityHour"], format='%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p')
  hourly_intensities["ActivityHour"] = pd.to_datetime(hourly_intensities ["ActivityHour"], format='%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p')
  hourly_steps["ActivityHour"] = pd.to_datetime(hourly_steps ["ActivityHour"], format='%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p')
  minute_calories["ActivityMinute"] = pd.to_datetime(minute_calories ["ActivityMinute"], format='%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p')
  minute_intensities["ActivityMinute"] = pd.to_datetime(minute_intensities ["ActivityMinute"], format='%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p')
  minute_METs["ActivityMinute"] = pd.to_datetime(minute_METs ["ActivityMinute"], format='%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p')
  minute_sleep["date"] = pd.to_datetime(minute_sleep ["date"], format='%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p')
  minute_steps["ActivityMinute"] = pd.to_datetime(minute_steps ["ActivityMinute"], format='%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p')
  weight["Date"] = pd.to_datetime(weight ["Date"], format='%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p')
  ```
- Saving the cleaned version of the datasets
  ```{python}
  for name, df in datasets:
  df.to_csv(f"{name}_cleaned.csv", index = False)
  print(f"Dataset {name} saved as {name}_cleaned.csv")
  ```

## Analyze
The analysis phase focuses on extracting meaningful insights from the prepared data. This involves organizing and formatting the data for analysis, performing calculations, and identifying trends and relationships within the data. By aggregating and structuring the data effectively, analysts can uncover unexpected patterns and insights that can be used to address specific business questions and inform decision-making. <br>
> I used SQL for this step

> Which hours of the day have the highest average calorie burn across all users?
  ```sql
  SELECT
    FORMAT_TIMESTAMP('%H', ActivityHour) AS Hour,
    ROUND(AVG(Calories), 2) AS AverageCalories
  FROM third-project-444513.bellabeat.hourly_calories
  GROUP BY Hour
  ORDER BY AverageCalories DESC;
  ```

| Hour | AverageCalories  |

<br>

Conclusions:
- The calorie burn peaks around the early evening hours (19:00 - 20:00), which suggests that users tend to engage in physical activities or exercise during this time.
- Lunchtime (12:00 - 14:00) also shows higher calorie burn, possibly due to midday workouts or movement.
- Early morning hours (05:00 - 08:00) and late-night hours (22:00 - 03:00) exhibit significantly lower calorie burn, aligning with typical rest or sleep periods.

<br>

Conclusions:
- Heart rate values are lowest during the early morning hours (02:00 - 05:00), indicating restful sleep.
- Heart rates increase after 06:00, peaking mid-morning (10:00 - 12:00) and again in the late afternoon (16:00 - 19:00), reflecting periods of increased physical activity or stress.
- Evening hours (20:00 - 23:00) show a gradual decline in heart rate, consistent with relaxation or winding down for the day.

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/39d85796-f978-4b94-b477-6cbfdb5cbdcd)
<br>

Conclusions:
- Wednesday (Day 3) has the highest average calorie burn, followed closely by Friday (Day 5) and Thursday (Day 4).
- Tuesday (Day 2) shows the lowest calorie burn, possibly indicating a midweek lull in physical activity.
- Weekend days (Saturday and Sunday) donâ€™t exhibit the highest values, which may reflect reduced physical activity despite more free time.

Conclusions:
- Step totals are minimal during the night (00:00 - 05:00), as expected during sleep.
- Steps begin to increase early morning (06:00 - 08:00), peaking around late morning to early afternoon (10:00 - 14:00).
- Evening hours (18:00 - 19:00) also see high step counts, possibly due to post-work walks or exercise.
- A dip is observed late in the evening (20:00 onwards) as users wind down.

Conclusions: 
- METs values show a slight decrease minute-by-minute in the early data (00:00 - 00:09).
- This could be due to transitioning into rest or lower activity levels post-midnight.
- To capture a full trend, extending the query for a complete 24-hour period would provide better insights into METs variations during the day.
